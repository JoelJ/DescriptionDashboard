View plugin for Jenkins that sorts the builds of jobs into a table. Each row being bound by the description.

The plugin includes a pre-build step that allows you to dynamically set the description of the build.

An example usecase is automatically set the description of the build to be the SCM revision.
Then all the builds with the same build number are grouped together.
Giving you a view of the entire pipeline and it's history on one page.
